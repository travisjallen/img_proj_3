All of the necessary folders to run this code are contained in this submission folder.

See section 4.3 of my report for instructions to run problem_4.py. The folder "images" 
contains the images for my "toy example" in the folder "lola_images"

You will need to have NUMBA to run anything with the function gaussian_lowpass(). If you
don't have NUMBA, this will still work, you just have to comment out the decorator on the 
function. This also means the code will take on the order of 10X longer to run (still under 
20 seconds but who has time for that).
